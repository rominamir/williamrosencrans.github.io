    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm William Rosencrans, a PhD candidate in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).
      My research centers around mitochondrial biology — especially the processes that regulate mitophagy, mitochondrial calcium flux, and ion channel dynamics. I’m particularly interested in the role of VDAC proteins and transcriptional regulators like KLF4 in neurodegenerative diseases.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before Caltech, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Physics with a minor in Biology from Colgate University. During my undergraduate and post-baccalaureate years, I conducted research in chromatin biophysics, ecology, and single-molecule electrophysiology. I later joined the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where I applied single-molecule techniques to study mitochondrial membrane channels like VDACs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, I work at the interface of biophysics, cell biology, and systems neuroscience — with the goal of better understanding how mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside the lab, I’m passionate about science communication, coffee, and hiking coastal trails.
